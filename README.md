# Personal Website Template

All css and javascript is self contained. Please remember to give credit to me.

## How to download?

Go to the latest release in the middle of the sidebar to the right, and download the .zip file. Then extract it to your desired location.

## How do I edit it?

You can directly fork this repository and then edit it in github and publish to github pages/cloudflare pages, or (this is recommended) download the latest release and edit it (Plz using linux) in webstorm. I personally prefer webstorm as an IDE, but you can use anything from Neovim to Notepad to edit this.

## What credit do I need to give?

You MUST give credit to me from this by putting, designed by Ivory Hnt in the footer, with a link to my website. This can be done by putting this in the footer of ALL of the pages on the website (if you remove the footer, it must be on the bottom of the website. I do actively enforce this)
