## How to download?

Go to the latest release in the middle of the sidebar to the right, and download the .zip file. Then extract it to your desired location.

## How do I edit it?

You can directly fork this repository and then edit it in github and publish to github pages/cloudflare pages, or (this is recommended) download the latest release and edit it (Plz using linux) in webstorm. I personally prefer webstorm as an IDE, but you can use anything from Neovim to Notepad to edit this.
